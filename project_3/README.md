## About
In this project, I utilized Matlab to implement polynomial spline techniques to animate an image.

## Using Project 3
To run the code for this project, run `project_3.m`. This will create an animated version of a smiley-face turning into a frowning face.

## Notes
The technique used is to create three images of an animation and then use polynomial spline to insert frames in-between the sequence of pictures.
