# Numerical Computations in Python and Matlab

## Overview
During my sophomore year at USC, I took MATH 458: Numerical Methods, a class in which we completed a series of projects in Python and Matlab that entailed significant numerical computations, error and data visualization, animations, and post-project write-ups. I've compiled them all here.

##Projects
### Project 1: Error Visualization of Numerical Approximations of Roots of a Polynomial
In this project, I utilized Python to test different mathematical methods of calculating the roots of a quadratic polynomial and compared them to the quadratic formula. As it turns out, methods such as a inverse-root approach and a Taylor series approximation have both benefits and drawbacks to the quadratic formula.
