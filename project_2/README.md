## About
In this project, I utilized Matlab to implement Newton's method to solve for the solutions to the equation $z^4-1=0$.

## Using Project 2
To run the code for this project, run `project_2.m`. This will be the default image of a fractal. By uncommenting certain parts of the code, the images seen in the `images` folder can be generated.

## Notes
The file `assignment.pdf` is the project assigned to us, and `report.pdf` is my write-up. The report has interesting comments about the images seen in `images` and an exploration about the barriers and edge behavior.
