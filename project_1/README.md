## About
In this project, I utilized Python to test different mathematical methods of calculating the roots of a quadratic polynomial and compared them to the quadratic formula. As it turns out, methods such as a inverse-root approach and a Taylor series approximation have both benefits and drawbacks to the quadratic formula.

## Using Project 1
To run the code for this project, run `project_1.py`. A total of 9 graphs will be created, all of which can be saved as figures.

## Notes
The file `assignment.pdf` is the project assigned to us, and `report.pdf` is my write-up. The report has interesting correlations about the different methods for numerically computing roots.
